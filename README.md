# Automated Testing for E-commerce Website

## Introduction

This repository contains an automated testing strategy for the e-commerce website [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/). The goal of this project is to ensure the quality and functionality of the website through systematic testing.

## Part 1: Test Planning

### Test Strategy Document

#### Objectives of Testing
- Ensure the website's functionality meets requirements.
- Verify that key features work as expected.
- Identify and report defects.
- Ensure a positive user experience.

#### Scope of Testing
- **In-Scope:** User registration, product search, adding items to the cart, checkout process, order management.
- **Out-of-Scope:** Non-functional requirements such as performance testing.

#### Testing Levels
- **Unit Testing:** Verify individual components.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that components work together.
- **System Testing:** Validate the entire system against requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Ensure the system meets business requirements.

#### Testing Types
- **Functional Testing:** Verify functionality against requirements.
- **Usability Testing:** Ensure a positive user experience.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

#### Entry and Exit Criteria
- **Entry Criteria:** Test environment is set up, test data is prepared, all dependencies are resolved.
- **Exit Criteria:** All test cases executed, critical defects resolved, test summary report completed.

#### Test Environment and Tools
- **Environment:** Local machine with Chrome browser.
- **Tools:** Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Maven, ExtentReports.

#### Risk Analysis
- **High Risk:** New feature implementations, third-party integrations.
- **Medium Risk:** Changes to existing features.
- **Low Risk:** Minor UI changes.

## Part 2: Test Case Design

### Functional Test Cases

1. **User Registration:**
   - Verify that a new user can register successfully.
   - Verify that registration with an existing email fails.

2. **Product Search:**
   - Verify that users can search for products using the search box.
   - Verify that relevant products are displayed based on the search query.

3. **Adding Items to Cart:**
   - Verify that users can add products to the cart.
   - Verify that the cart count increases when a product is added.

4. **Checkout Process:**
   - Verify that users can proceed to checkout.
   - Verify that users can complete the purchase.

5. **Order Management:**
   - Verify that users can view their order history.
   - Verify that order details are displayed correctly.

### Edge and Boundary Test Cases

1. **User Registration:**
   - Register with the maximum and minimum allowed characters in each field.
   - Register with special characters in fields.

2. **Product Search:**
   - Search with very long text.
   - Search with special characters.

## Part 3: Test Automation

### Test Automation Framework

**Framework:** Selenium WebDriver with TestNG
**Reason for Selection:** 
- Selenium is widely used for web application testing.
- TestNG provides powerful test configuration and reporting.
